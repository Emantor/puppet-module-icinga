# == Template: icinga::server::vhost_nginx.conf
#
# This is an example of what your webserverconfig could look like
#
# Please be aware that the configuration below is no more than an example of
# how an icinga vhost could be used in an already properly configured webserver.
# That webserver should be properly secured and configured before it connected
# to internet of even another network.
# Warning: a weak monitoring server is like a wiki (thus very valuable) for any
# hacker. It may even function as a steppingstone into other systems should any
# vuln of nrpe or any other system be abused.
#
# === Usage
# before using this you should take care of the following:
#
# Apache has native support for cgi execution, nginx hasn't.
# That means that one needs to add this to nginx and how to do that is
# outside the scope of this documentation. A good read might be:
# http://wiki.nginx.org/FcgiExample
#
# If the above has been taken care of you may create a copy of
# this file in your sites-available directory.
